# Strands Agents Learning Course

A mini course on building AI agents with the [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/) framework, from beginner to advanced levels.

> WARNING: A tiny Ads here for building your [Streamlit App Demonstrating Strands Agents](https://github.com/davidshtian/Strands-Agents-on-Streamlit).

## Course Overview

This course takes you through a complete journey of learning how to build, customize, deploy, and orchestrate AI agents using the Strands Agents framework. All examples use the Amazon Bedrock Nova Lite model (`us.amazon.nova-lite-v1:0`).
