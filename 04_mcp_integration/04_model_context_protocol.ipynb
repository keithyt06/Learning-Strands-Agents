    "## Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most powerful features of Strands Agents is its ability to integrate with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This integration allows your agents to access a wide range of external tools and resources, significantly expanding their capabilities beyond what's available in the standard toolset.\n",

    "## What is the Model Context Protocol?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and resources. It defines a common interface for exposing functionality to AI systems, allowing for seamless integration between different platforms and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of MCP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standardized Communication:** MCP provides a common language for AI models and tools to communicate\n",
    "2. **Tool Discovery:** MCP servers can expose multiple tools, and clients can discover available tools\n",
    "3. **Resource Access:** Beyond tools (functions), MCP also supports accessing resources like files, databases, or APIs\n",
    "4. **Transport Independence:** MCP works over various [transport mechanisms](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports) (Streamable HTTP, stdio, etc.)\n",
    "5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Tools from one platform can be used by agents on different platforms"

    "## Best Practices for MCP Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with MCP in Strands Agents, consider these best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Tool Descriptions**: Provide detailed descriptions so the agent knows when and how to use the tool\n",
    "2. **Graceful Error Handling**: Return informative error messages to help the agent recover\n",
    "3. **Well-defined Schemas**: Use schemas to specify required inputs and expected outputs\n",
    "4. **Focused Tools**: Create specialized tools rather than multi-purpose \"Swiss Army knife\" tools\n",
    "5. **Complementary Design**: Design MCP tools to work well with other tool types\n",

    "1. MCP provides a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and resources\n",
    "2. Strands Agents can connect to MCP servers using the `MCPClient` class\n",
    "3. MCP tools can be used alongside built-in and custom tools in Strands Agents\n",
